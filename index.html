      Coronavirus (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic">COVID-19</a>) pandemic time-series of the number of deaths accross the most affected countries plus Japan and South Korea. <br>
      Forecast of the evolution of the time-series with a simple a naive growth curve prediction model based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">logistic function</a>. <br> <br>

      Notes: <br> 
      <ul>
          <li> The prediction (with confidence interval) is made whenever there are at least 21 values since the first reported death in a country. </li>
          <li> <strong>"France (adjusted)"</strong> country has been added and corresponds to adjusted values for number of deaths in France. Indeed, the number of deaths from <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tablissement_d%27h%C3%A9bergement_pour_personnes_%C3%A2g%C3%A9es_d%C3%A9pendantes">EHPAD</a> were not taken into account in the statistics records until April 1st 2020. Therefore, the number of deaths before the date of April 2nd 2020 have been multiplied by factor of 1.3 to take into account the fact that they were underestimated (1.3 is rough estimate based on the records from April 2nd to April 4th). </li> <br>
