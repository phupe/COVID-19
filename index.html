      Coronavirus (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic">COVID-19</a>) pandemic time-series of the number of deaths accross the most affected countries plus Japan and South Korea. <br>
      Forecast of the evolution of the time-series. Two prediction models are available (choose the model to display with the button on the graphs): <br>
      
      <ul>
          <li> Predict (L): simple a naive growth curve prediction model based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">logictic function</a>. This model tends to underestimate the predicted values.</li>
          <li> Predict (R): simple a naive growth curve prediction model based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_logistic_function">Richards' curve</a>. This model seems to better fit the data but the predicted values may be less reliable when few data are available.</li>
      </ul>

          <li> <a href="usa.absolute.norm.html">Relative number of deaths</a> per millions of inhabitants of each country (Time has been set such that Time0 is ~ 2 deaths for 1 million of inhabitants)  </li>

      </ul>

      Notes: <br> 
      <ul>
          <li> The prediction (with confidence interval) is made whenever there are at least 21 values since the first reported death in a country. </li>
      </ul>

      Data: <br>
