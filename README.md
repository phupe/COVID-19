Coronavirus ([COVID-19]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic")) pandemic time-series of the number of deaths accross the most affected countries.

Forecast of the evolution of the time-series. Two prediction models are available (choose the model to display with the button on the graphs):

* Predict (L): simple a naive growth curve prediction model based on a [logictic function]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"). This model tends to underestimate the predicted values.
* Predict (R): simple a naive growth curve prediction model based on a [Richards' curve]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_logistic_function"). This model seems to better fit the data but the predicted values may be less reliable when few data are available.
